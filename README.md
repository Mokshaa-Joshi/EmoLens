This project is an emotion detection system using facial landmarks and deep learning. It captures real-time video from a webcam, detects faces, and predicts emotions such as anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutrality using a pre-trained convolutional neural network model. The system also analyzes eye aspect ratio to detect blinks and other facial features for comprehensive face analysis. Detected emotions and face information are displayed on the video feed in real-time.
